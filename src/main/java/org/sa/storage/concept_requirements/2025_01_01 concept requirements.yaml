Objectives:
  - Generate definitions that are extremely concise, laconic, and to the point.
  - The output should capture the essence of the concept in the shortest possible form without losing fundamental meaning.

Key Requirements:
  Length:
    - Ideal length is way below 140 characters.
    - Shorter is better, even if it sacrifices some clarity.
    - Use 2-3 words if possible.
    - No unnecessary details.
  Format:
    - One line, separated by "="
    - no redundant words.
    - A very short example or a practical use case is tolerable, example:
        - "en dash (–)=dash for range or connection, example: 'New York – Boston', type it Alt+0150"
    - if the word is not a name, use lowercase letter to start a phrase, example:
        - "hub=central point, where things are executed."
  Tone:
    - Direct and terse (brief).
    - The goal is to convey just the essence.
  Content Structure:
    - "{$Concept} = {$Short Definition}, (possibly) {$Example}, (possibly) {$Key Detail}."
    - Use the most laconic language possible.

Examples:
  - "SLI=Service Level Indicator — Metric measuring system performance."
  - "URL=Uniform Resource Locators."
  - "en dash (–)=dash for range or connection, example: 'New York – Boston', type: Alt+0150"
  - "substitution=replacement"
  - "hub=central point, where things are executed."

Guidelines:
  - Prioritize brevity over precision. example:
      - "substitution=replacement"
  - If a longer phrase or term can be reduced to one or two words, do so.
  - Essence only — avoid elaboration.
  - Shorter and less clear is better than longer and more precise.
  - NB! If the concept key is an acronym or initialism, full term has to be spelled out like this (with "space + dash + space" afterwards):
      - "SLI=Service Level Indicator — metric measuring system performance."
  - Or even better (if the full version can serve as a simple definition):
      - "URL=Uniform Resource Locators."

conceptFileGuidelines:
  objective:
    - store each concept as a self-contained evaluation unit
    - keep definitions extremely concise and laconic
    - capture essence with minimal wording
    - make user expectations and grading math explicit and mechanical
    - avoid ambiguity for user and evaluator

  fileFormat:
    type: plain text
    parsing:
      - file is read line-by-line
      - no line contains metadata or structure markers
      - no indentation, prefixes, or extra whitespace are allowed
      - each line represents data only
    structure:
      - line 1: key
      - line 2: description
      - line 3: user answer requirements (the way user will be asked about the concept)
      - line 4: ai evaluation instructions (the way ai will evaluate user answer)
      - line 5: topic (predefined)
    constraints:
      - exactly 5 lines per file
      - lines must appear in the defined order
      - no empty lines allowed
      - no leading or trailing spaces on any line

  structure_by_each_line:
    line1_key:
      rules:
        semantic:
          - concept name only
          - lowercase unless proper noun or acronym
          - windows filename friendly
          - must exactly match filename
          - must be unique across all concepts
          - use " - " (space-hyphen-space) to join closely related concepts
          - optional parentheses may contain a context or hint
          - context or hint exists only to disambiguate meaning
          - context or hint must NOT reveal the definition
          - context or hint must avoid using the same words as the definition
          - context or hint should force the user to produce the defining terms themselves
          - key must never contain the answer implicitly or explicitly
        technical_validation:
          - key must not contain characters:
              - semicolon (;)
              - comma (,)
              - backslash (\)
              - forward slash (/)
              - colon (:)
              - asterisk (*)
              - question mark (?)
              - double quote (")
              - less-than sign (<)
              - greater-than sign (>)
              - vertical bar (|)
          - key must not end with a dot (.)
      examples:
        - "RPO (requirement)"
        - "CIF (regulation)"
        - "bean factory - application context"

    line2_description:
      rules:
        - one-line definition only
        - extremely concise, essence only
        - ideal length well below 140 characters
        - prefer 2–6 words; short sentence if unavoidable
        - acronyms and initialisms must be expanded here
        - expanded form must be capitalized
        - use long dash (—) after expanded acronym
        - lowercase unless proper noun
        - optional example or key detail only if it improves clarity
      examples:
        - "Recovery Point Objective — max data loss measured in time."
        - "Critical Information Function — key system impacting financial operations."

    line3_userRequirements:
      rules:
        - include EXACT key that has to be explained or defined or named or expanded, etc.
        - explicit instructions for how the user must answer, but not give out the answer
        - clearly state minimum requirements, but not give out the answer
        - quantify expectations where possible (counts, conditions)
        - written for humans, short and direct
        - try to not use the same words as in definition (user has to come up with these words himself)
        - do not instruct user how long should his answer be.
        - for initialisms, abbreviations and acronyms always ask to expand meaning of each letter and give a general narrative of a concept meaning.
        - ""
      examples:
        - "Please name >=5 abstraction examples."
        - "Explain RPO. *Expand what each letter means? **R? **P? **O? *Provide a short narrative"
      userInstructionSyntax:
        purpose: "Explain the special markup used in user answer instructions for formatting."
        rules:

          - "**   → new line + 2 tabs"
          - "*    → new line + 1 tab"
        example:
          rawInstruction: "Explain RPO. *Expand what each letter means? **R? **P? **O? *Provide a short narrative"
          rendered:
            - "Explain RPO."

            - "        O?"
            - "    Provide a short narrative"

    line4_aiEvaluation:
      rules:
        - list exact elements to check in the answer:
            - start with "User has to"
            - formulation should directly correspond to what was user asked about
            - explicit point allocation per element:
              - evaluation point, example: "2/10"
            - example: "User has to expand each letter correctly (R=2/10, P=2/10, O=2/10), and include a short narrative (1/10)."
        - define score cap:
          - example: "Without these elements cap score at 3/10."
        - do include math formula of perfect score:
            - explicit math showing how 10/10 is reached
            - do state that it is a math formula
            - example : "Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 1/10 + 3/10 = 10/10."
        - no interpretation or subjective judgment
      examples:
        - "User has to expand each letter correctly (R=2/10, P=2/10, O=2/10), and include a short narrative (1/10). Without these elements cap score at 3/10. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 1/10 + 3/10= 10/10."
        - "User has to mention at least 5 abstraction examples. For each correct abstraction example user gets 2/10 points. 5 examples are enough to provide 10/10 evaluation. Perfect score math formula: '5 * 2/10 = 10/10'."

    line5_topic:
      rules:
        - exactly one topic must be assigned
        - topic must be chosen from the predefined list

  preservedPrinciples:
    - brevity over precision
    - essence over completeness
    - shorter and slightly unclear preferred over longer and precise
    - definitions must stand alone
    - evaluation must be reproducible and deterministic

  examples:
abstraction examples
interfaces, modules, packages, APIs, frameworks, ORMs, microservices, VMs, containers.
Please name >=5 abstraction examples.
User has to mention at least 5 abstraction examples. For each correct abstraction example user gets 2/10 points. 5 examples are enough to provide 10/10 evaluation. The math for perfect evaluation is '5 * 2/10 = 10/10'.

abstraction
process of hiding complex details, exposing only essential features to manage complexity.

conceptFileGuidelines:
  objective:
    - store each concept as a self-contained evaluation unit
    - keep definitions extremely concise and laconic
    - capture essence with minimal wording
    - make user expectations and grading math explicit and mechanical
    - avoid ambiguity for user and evaluator
    - unit can should be able to stand alone, no extra context should be needed.

  fileFormat:
    type: plain text
    parsing:
      - file is read line-by-line
      - no line contains metadata or structure markers
      - no indentation, prefixes, or extra whitespace are allowed
      - each line represents data only
    structure:
      - line 1: key
      - line 2: description
      - line 3: user answer requirements (the way user will be asked about the concept)
      - line 4: ai evaluation instructions (the way ai will evaluate user answer)
      - line 5: topic (predefined)
    constraints:
      - exactly 5 lines per file
      - lines must appear in the defined order
      - no empty lines allowed
      - no leading or trailing spaces on any line

  structure_by_each_line:
    line1_key:
      rules:
        semantic:
          - concept name only
          - lowercase unless proper noun or acronym
          - windows filename friendly
          - must exactly match filename
          - must be unique across all concepts
          - use " - " (space-hyphen-space) to join closely related concepts
          - optional parentheses may contain a context or hint
          - context or hint exists only to disambiguate meaning
          - context or hint must NOT reveal the definition
          - context or hint must avoid using the same words as the definition
          - context or hint should force the user to produce the defining terms themselves
          - key must never contain the answer implicitly or explicitly
        technical_validation:
          - key must not contain characters:
              - semicolon (;)
              - comma (,)
              - backslash (\)
              - forward slash (/)
              - colon (:)
              - asterisk (*)
              - question mark (?)
              - double quote (")
              - less-than sign (<)
              - greater-than sign (>)
              - vertical bar (|)
          - key must not end with a dot (.)
      evaluation_elements:
        - Whenever a concept key is an initialism, abbreviation, or acronym, each letter or component requiring expansion must be treated as a separate element and  each explicitly included in both the user answer instructions and the AI evaluation instructions.
        - For example in key "RPO (requirement)" separate elements that needs separate treatment and consideration are letters R, P and O
      examples:
        - "RPO (requirement)"
        - "CIF (regulation)"
        - "bean factory - application context"

    line2_description:
      rules:
        - one-line definition only
        - extremely concise, essence only
        - ideal length well below 140 characters
        - prefer 2–6 words; short sentence if unavoidable
        - acronyms and initialisms must be expanded here
        - expanded form must be capitalized
        - use long dash (—) after expanded acronym
        - lowercase unless proper noun
        - optional example or key detail only if it improves clarity
        - if a concept key is a name of any type of software component (application, software, platform, framework, library, service, tool, plugin, API, middleware, etc):
            - definition (line2) has to state what type of software components it is
      evaluation_elements:
        - clearly distinguish the separate elements that make up the definition, as these will directly correspond to the user instructions in line 3 and the AI evaluation in line 4
      examples:
        - "Recovery Point Objective — max data loss measured in time."
        - "Critical Information Function — key system impacting financial operations."
        - "framework that simplifies listing, designing, documenting, and testing RESTful web APIs"

    line3_userRequirements:
      rules:
        - user answer instructions must directly correspond to the elements in the concept definition:
            - elements in user answer requirements has to never reveal any part of the answer
            - for concepts where breaking into multiple elements would reveal the answer, define a single element called *meaning of the concept
        - include EXACT key that has to be explained or defined or named or expanded, etc.
        - explicit instructions for how the user must answer, but not give out the answer
        - clearly state minimum requirements, but not give out the answer
        - quantify expectations where possible (counts, conditions)
        - written for humans, short and direct
        - try to not use the same words as in definition (user has to come up with these words himself)
        - avoid hinting the answer in user instructions whenever possible
        - do not instruct user how long should his answer be.
        - for initialisms, abbreviations and acronyms always ask to expand meaning of each letter and give a general narrative of a concept meaning.
        - if a concept key is a name of any type of software component (application, software, platform, framework, library, service, tool, plugin, API, middleware, etc):
          - user instruction (line3) has to prompt user to name this software component type
      examples:
        - "Please name >=5 abstraction examples."
        - "Explain RPO. *Expand what each letter means? **R? **P? **O? *Provide a short narrative"
        - "Please describe concept 'Swagger': *name the type of software component it is *name which part of software it addresses *provide at least one key function it supports"

      userInstructionSyntax:
        purpose: "Explain the special markup used in user answer instructions for formatting."
        rules:
          - "**** → new line + 4 tabs"
          - "***  → new line + 3 tabs"
          - "**   → new line + 2 tabs"
          - "*    → new line + 1 tab"
        example:
          rawInstruction: "Explain RPO. *Expand what each letter means? **R? **P? **O? *Provide a short narrative"
          rendered:
            - "Explain RPO."
            - "    Expand what each letter means?"
            - "        R?"
            - "        P?"
            - "        O?"
            - "    Provide a short narrative"

    line4_aiEvaluation:
      rules:
        - AI evaluation must directly correspond to both the definition and user answer instructions
        - list exact elements to check in the answer:
            - start with "User has to"
            - formulation should directly correspond to what was user asked about
            - explicit point allocation per element:
              - evaluation point, example: "2/10"
              - do not avoid mentioning that for each element "add points in the math formula explicitly"
            - example: "User has to expand each letter correctly. Add points to score for each explicitly in the math formula (R=3/10, P=3/10, O=3/10). User has to include a short note on the concept meaning - you score it (1/10). You add this point in the math formula explicitly."
        - do include math formula of perfect score:
            - explicit math showing how 10/10 is reached
            - do state that it is a math formula
            - example : "Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 1/10 + 3/10 = 10/10."
            - all points in the evaluation must be whole numbers like this "1/10" and never use fractions or halves
        - no interpretation or subjective judgment
      examples:
        - "User has to expand each letter correctly. Add points to score for each explicitly in the math formula (R=3/10, P=3/10, O=3/10). User has to include a short note on the concept meaning - you score it (1/10). You add this point in the math formula explicitly. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 3/10 + 3/10 + 1/10= 10/10."
        - "User has to mention at least 5 abstraction examples. For each correct abstraction example user gets 2/10 points. 5 examples are enough to provide 10/10 evaluation. Add points in the math formula explicitly. Perfect score math formula: '5 * 2/10 = 10/10'."
        - "User has to correctly identify the type of software (framework) — score 3/10. User has to identify which part of software it addresses (RESTful APIs) — score 3/10. User has to provide at least one key function it supports (listing, designing, documenting, or testing) — score 4/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 3/10 + 4/10 = 10/10."

DefinitionGuidelines:
  Objectives:
    - Generate definitions that are extremely concise, laconic, and to the point.
    - Capture the essence of the concept in the shortest possible form without losing fundamental meaning.
    - When relevant, provide a short example or key detail to clarify usage.
  Length:
    - Ideal length is well below 140 characters.
    - Use 2-3 words if possible; shorter is better even at some clarity cost.
    - Avoid unnecessary details.
  Format:
    - One line per concept.
    - Use "=" to separate key from definition; only one "=" per line.
    - Start non-proper nouns with lowercase letters.
    - Include a very short example or context if helpful: e.g., "en dash (–)=dash for range or connection, example: 'New York – Boston', type Alt+0150"
    - Acronyms/initialisms must be spelled out in full in the definition: e.g., "SLI=Service Level Indicator — metric measuring system performance."
  Tone:
    - Direct, terse, and brief.
    - Avoid unnecessary explanation or elaboration.
  ContentStructure:
    - "{$Concept} = {$Short Definition}, (optional) {$Example}, (optional) {$Key Detail}"
    - Definitions must be self-explanatory.
  Examples:
    - "SLI=Service Level Indicator — metric measuring system performance."
    - "URL=Uniform Resource Locators."
    - "en dash (–)=dash for range or connection, example: 'New York – Boston', type Alt+0150"
    - "substitution=replacement"
    - "hub=central point, where things are executed."
  Guidelines:
    - Prioritize brevity over precision.
    - If a longer phrase can be reduced to 1-2 words, do so.
    - Essence only — avoid elaboration.
    - Shorter and less clear is better than longer and more precise.
    - Use acronyms/initialisms full spelling in definitions, but keep it concise.
    - Include examples, context, or minor clarifications only if they help understanding.
  TopicAssignment:
    - Optional: Suggest a single relevant topic from the provided list.
    - If the concept fits multiple topics, select the most precise one.

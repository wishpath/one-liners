DBA, instruction 1, instruction2, instruction3, instruction4
deque, Only rate 10/10 if user mentions 'keeping insertion order' and 'ArrayDeque', metioning 'allows access at both ends' is important too, do not confuse with other data structures
REST, Only rate above 6/10 if user mentions 'Representational State Transfer', If user does did not mention 'Representational State Transfer' the largest evaluation can be 6/10 (or can be even lower)
RBAC, Acronym must be fully expanded as 'Role-Based Access Control'; missing or incomplete expansion caps the score at 6/10; do not rate above 6/10 unless all four words appear

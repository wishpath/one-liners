deterministic
Same input will always produce the same outcome.
Please describe concept 'deterministic': *what inputs are like? *what is result like?
User has to describe the behavior of inputs (same input) — score 5/10. User has to describe the consistency of results (always same outcome) — score 5/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 5/10 + 5/10 = 10/10.

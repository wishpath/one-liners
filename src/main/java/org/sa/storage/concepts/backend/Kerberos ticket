User has to provide its format/type and example (binary) — score 2/10. User has to name where it is created (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) — score 1/10. User has to name where it is stored (client cache) — score 1/10. User has to explain how it is stored regarding time (temporarily) — score 1/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 = 10/10.

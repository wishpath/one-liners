User has to describe its purpose/function (authentication) — score 4/10. User has to describe how it is produced: what it is made from (password for the target service) — score 2/10. User has to describe how it is produced: what security measure is applied (encrypted) — score 2/10. User has to describe what requests it (Kerberos Authentication Service) — score 2/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 4/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 = 10/10.

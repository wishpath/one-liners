User has to describe its purpose/function (authentication) — score 3/10. User has to name what type of data unit it is (file) — score 3/10. User has to list its contents: username — 1/10, service name — 1/10, key — 1/10. User has to provide a short narrative of how it works (used to request Kerberos tickets) — score 1/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 3/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 = 10/10.

User has to correctly describe what it does (holds multiple items together as a collection) — score 5/10. User has to correctly state its immutability — score 3/10. User has to correctly describe its order property (elements maintain position) — score 2/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 4/10 + 3/10 + 3/10 = 10/10.

User has to correctly name the intended user (operating system) — score 3/10. User has to correctly describe its content (list of executables) — score 3/10. User has to give at least one correct example (one example alone is enough for full points) such as running java, python, or git without a full path — score 4/10. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 3/10 + 4/10 = 10/10.

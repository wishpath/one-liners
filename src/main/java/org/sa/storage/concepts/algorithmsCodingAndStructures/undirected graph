undirected graph
Nodes connected bi-directionally.
Please describe concept 'undirected graph': *elements involved *connection rule
User has to identify the elements involved (nodes and connections) — score 5/10. User has to describe the connection rule (connections work both ways) — score 5/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 5/10 + 5/10 = 10/10.

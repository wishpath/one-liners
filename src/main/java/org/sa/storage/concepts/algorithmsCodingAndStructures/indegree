indegree
Number of incoming edges directed towards a node.
Please describe concept 'indegree': *what quality is being quantified? *specify element direction?
User has to describe what quality is being quantified (incoming connections/edges) — score 7/10. User has to specify the direction of the element (towards the node) — score 3/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 7/10 + 3/10 = 10/10.

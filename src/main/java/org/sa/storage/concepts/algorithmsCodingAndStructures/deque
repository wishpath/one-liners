deque
Double-ended queue maintaining insertion order, allows access at both ends, implemented in Java as ArrayDeque.
Please describe concept 'deque': *ordering behavior *access pattern *Java implementation
User has to mention that it keeps insertion order — score 4/10. User has to mention that elements can be accessed at both ends — score 3/10. User has to name the Java implementation (ArrayDeque) — score 3/10. Do not confuse with other data structures. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 4/10 + 3/10 + 3/10 = 10/10.

BOM
Byte Order Mark — special marker indicating text encoding and byte order.
Explain BOM. *Expand what each letter means? **B? **O? **M? *State its purpose
User has to correctly expand each letter. Add points explicitly in the math formula (B=3/10, O=3/10, M=3/10). User has to state its purpose (indicates text encoding and byte order) — score 1/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 3/10 + 3/10 + 1/10 = 10/10.

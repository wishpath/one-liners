VDE
value delivery engine — multiple agile teams with shared goal, having PI meeting every 10 weeks.
Explain VDE. *Expand what each letter means? **V? **D? **E? *name who the participants are *state what is common between participants *describe a key action they perform
User has to correctly expand V as Value — score 2/10. User has to correctly expand D as Delivery — score 2/10. User has to correctly expand E as Engine — score 2/10. User has to name the participants as teams — score 2/10. User has to state the common element as shared goal(s) — score 1/10. User has to describe a key action as holding a regular planning meeting — score 1/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 = 10/10.

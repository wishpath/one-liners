Explain CTO. *Expand what each letter means? **C? **T? **O? *Name the role type *Name the main responsibility
User has to expand each letter correctly. Add points to score for each explicitly in the math formula (C=2/10, T=2/10, O=2/10). User has to correctly name the role type (executive role) — score 2/10. User has to correctly describe the main responsibility (technology direction and innovation oversight) — score 2/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 = 10/10.

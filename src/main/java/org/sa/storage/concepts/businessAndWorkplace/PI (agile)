PI (agile)
Program Increment — multiple teams plan work for the upcoming weeks.
Explain PI (agile). *Expand what each letter means? **P? **I? *Provide a short narrative
User has to expand each letter correctly. Add points to score for each explicitly in the math formula (P=4/10, I=4/10). User has to include a short narrative explaining the concept — score 2/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 4/10 + 4/10 + 2/10 = 10/10.

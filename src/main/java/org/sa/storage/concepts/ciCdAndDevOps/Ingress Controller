User has to identify the type of component (Kubernetes component) — score 3/10. User has to state what it manages (access to services) — score 4/10. User has to specify which direction of access it controls (external) — score 3/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 4/10 + 3/10 = 10/10.

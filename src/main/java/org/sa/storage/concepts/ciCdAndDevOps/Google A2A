Google A2A
Google Agent to Agent — protocol enabling multiple agents collaborate.
Explain Google A2A. *Expand what each part means? **A? **2? **A? *State the type of software component it is *State its purpose
User has to correctly expand each part (A=Agent 2/10, 2=to 2/10, A=Agent 2/10). Add points explicitly in the math formula. User has to state the type of software component (protocol) — score 2/10. User has to state its purpose (enabling multiple agents to collaborate) — score 2/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 = 10/10.

software deployment outside regular schedule to fix critical issues.
Please explain concept 'emergency release': *what action is performed *what is the object of the action *what is unusual about its timing *why it is needed
User has to state the action performed (deployment) — score 2/10. User has to state the object of the action (software) — score 2/10. User has to state what is unusual about its timing (outside regular schedule) — score 3/10. User has to state the reason why it is needed (to fix critical issues). Stating the critical nature of the problem is required for full score — score 3/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 3/10 + 3/10 = 10/10.

consuming Ivy repositories in Gradle
Setting repository URL in build.gradle to enable use of Ivy modules and dependencies stored in the Ivy repo.
Please explain concept 'consuming Ivy repositories in Gradle': *in which file the configuration is made *what exactly has to be set *name 2 things it allows to use
User has to specify the configuration file (build.gradle) — score 3/10. User has to state what has to be set (repository URL) — score 3/10. User has to name exactly 2 things it allows to use (Ivy modules, Ivy dependencies). Each correct element gives 2/10. Stating 2 elements is enough to receive full score for this element — total 4/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 3/10 + 2 * 2/10 = 10/10.

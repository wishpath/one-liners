continuous integration components
VCS (e.g., Git), automated: builds, tests, feedback, build server (e.g., Jenkins).
Please explain concept 'continuous integration components': *list >=4 distinct components involved
User has to list >= 4 distinct continuous integration components. Each of the first three correct components gives 2/10. The fourth correct component gives 4/10. Listing 4 components is enough to receive full score. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 4/10 = 10/10.

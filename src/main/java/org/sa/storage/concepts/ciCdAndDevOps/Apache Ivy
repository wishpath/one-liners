Apache Ivy
Java dependency tool, fetches JARs. Can be used by most Java dependency tools: Gradle, Maven, Apache Ant
Please describe concept 'Apache Ivy': *name the type of software component it is *name the runtime ecosystem it is associated with *state in short what it does *name >=2 software components that use it
User has to correctly identify the software type as a dependency tool — score 3/10. User has to identify the runtime ecosystem as Java — score 2/10. User has to describe in very short what it does; stating "fetches JARs" or "retrieves JAR files" is sufficient for full score — score 3/10. User has to name >= 2 software components that use it (Gradle, Maven, Apache Ant; any 2). Stating 2 components is enough to receive full score for this element — score 2/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 3/10 + 2/10 + 3/10 + 2/10 = 10/10.

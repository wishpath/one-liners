API
Application Programming Interface — rules enabling software communication through endpoints.
Please describe concept 'API': *expand each letter *short general narrative of what it is *through what elements interactions are completed
User has to expand each letter correctly and add points explicitly (A=2/10, P=2/10, I=2/10). User has to provide a short general narrative of what it is (rules for software communication) — score 3/10. User has to mention endpoints — score 1/10. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 3/10 + 1/10 = 10/10.

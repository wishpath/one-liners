REST
Representational State Transfer — API architecture standard.
Please describe REST: *expand what each letter means? **R? **S? **T? *provide a short narrative
User has to expand each letter correctly (R=2/10, S=2/10, T=2/10). User has to provide a short narrative explaining the concept — score 4/10. Only award full 10/10 if user mentions 'Representational State Transfer'. Add points explicitly in the math formula. Perfect score math formula: 2/10 + 2/10 + 2/10 + 4/10 = 10/10.

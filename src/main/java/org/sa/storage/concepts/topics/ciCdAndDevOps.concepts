Argo CD=Argo Continuous Delivery - deploys app from Git repo to Kubernetes cluster.
CI/CD=C - continuous (automatic), I - integration (merging code and testing it), D - delivery (deploying).
DevOps=practices, principles, philosophies on automation of the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
DevSecOps=practice of integrating security into every phase of the software development and delivery pipeline.
Ingress Controller=Kubernetes component that manages external access to services.
Apache Ivy=Java dependency tool, fetches JARs.
Apache Ant=Java automation tool, runs XML scripts.
JFrog Artifactory=repository manager, stores JARs.
npm=JavaScript dependency manager, installs packages.
UrbanCode Deploy (UCD)=deployment tool, moves app between environments.
anonymous access to Artifactory=repository access without login.
Ivy integration to Gradle=Gradle plugin for Ivy repos, allows using Ivy modules and dependencies in Gradle builds.
Jenkins=app for automating tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment. Written in Java.
artifact (context: compilation)=file produced by a build process, like a JAR, WAR, or binary, ready for deployment.
artifactory=stores built artifacts (JAR, WAR, binaries), not source code.
assemble=specific phase within the build process - collecting and combining individual components into larger units.
build process=entire prep for execution - compiling files, linking libraries, and packaging into a distributable format.
code integration=combining code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.
continuous integration components=VCS (e.g., Git), automated: builds, tests, feedback, build server (e.g., Jenkins).
deploying=making app available on a target environment. For example production environment.
git stash=git command to temporarily save uncommitted changes for later retrieval.
heap space=memory area during program execution, for storing objects.
pipeline (IT)=process of building, testing and deploying. Often associated with automatisation.
roll out=deployment and activation of a new product or feature for use.
failover=automatic switch to a backup system when the primary fails.
pip=Python package manager, installs and manages libraries (e.g., pip install requests).
package manager examples by programming language=pip (Python), npm (JS), Maven/Gradle/Ivy (Java).

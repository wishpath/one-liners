DNS=Domain Name System - maps user-friendly domain names to numeric IP addresses.
SSL=Secure Sockets Layer - encryption of browser-server communication.
TLS=Transport Layer Security - encryption of browser-server communication; successor to SSL.
VPN=Virtual Private Network - encrypted connection to a remote server, hiding identity while accessing the internet.
VPN whitelisting=security measure that allows only specific IP addresses or devices to access a service through a VPN.

firewall opening=configuration that allows specific traffic through the firewall on designated ports or IP ranges.
subnet=subnetwork - segment of a larger network. Subnetting improves network performance, security, and organization.

latency=time delay between sending and receiving data, measured in milliseconds (ms).
uplink (networking)=outgoing traffic from your system to the network.
downlink (networking)=incoming traffic to your system from the network.
jitter=variation in packet delay over a network, measured in milliseconds (ms).
throughput (network)=actual amount of data successfully transmitted over a network in a given time, measured in bits per second (bps).

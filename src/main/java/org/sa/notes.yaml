problems:
  - 'abstraction examples' does not listen to additional instructions:
    - for explicit instruction use instruction A, for additional instruction use instruction B.
  - check if loaded concept matches the one in the separate file.
  - when loading concept from file, check if key matches file, and topic matches directory, else throw.
  - INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_USER: should be transfered to files manually
  - to wiki print time.now()
  - use file util where possible
  - make app : printTopics (separate from wiki exporter)
  - TopicsPrinterApp update when topics will be folder names rather than filenames
  - open wiki text files after generating them
ideas:
  - there could be extra note for key for the user before the answer
    - it should tell what is expected to be mentioned in the answer
      - this should basically directly respond to the extra instructions given for this key
  - spaced repetition?
  - should score 0 be explicit?
  - additional instruction specific to a single concept
  - as every concept has been tried:
      - check how many of phrases has never received a score of 8, then 9, then 10
      - if for some concepts it is impossible to receive 10, add additional instructions for the AI. provide a couple of examples with answers that would match the evaluation of 10/10

maybe no, not needed:
  - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
  - ai generated instruction
  - new command "pick exact <key>"
  - make command 'score 1' - print all the concepts with score 1

how to:
  - add submodule:
    - git submodule add <repository-link> <target-folder>
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions color in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

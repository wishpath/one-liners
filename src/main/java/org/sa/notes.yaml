problems:
  - additional instructions:
    - when formulating AI question — if entry not null - add instruction

ideas:
  - spaced repetition?
  - should score 0 be explicit?
  - additional instruction specific to a single concept
  - as every concept has been tried:
      - check how many of phrases has never received a score of 8, then 9, then 10
      - if for some concepts it is impossible to receive 10, add additional instructions for the AI. provide a couple of examples with answers that would match the evaluation of 10/10

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ
   - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
   - prep and fix console colors:
      - blue - global narratives
      - cyan - inner narratives
      - yellow - AI
      - bright yellow - extra data
   - it is ok to not write unit tests if:
      - it's a prototype or throw-away app
      - there's only one developer.
      - input files are small and predictable.
      - You’ll iterate quickly, and the app will likely be rewritten or discarded.

maybe no, not needed:
  - make command 'score 1' - print all the concepts with score 1

how to:
  - add submodule:
    - git submodule add <repository-link> <target-folder>
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

TOTALLY WRONG:
  Please explain this: GPA
    General Purpose Application
    0/10. GPA typically stands for "Grade Point Average," not "General Purpose Application." A correct definition of GPA would be "Grade Point Average, a measure of academic performance."
  The default definition: general purpose app.`

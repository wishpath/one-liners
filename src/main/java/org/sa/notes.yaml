problems:
  - do tests?

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - ?

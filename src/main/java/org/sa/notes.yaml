problems:
  - do tests?

ideas:
  - add score "7, 8 - 1; 9 - 2; 10 - 4"
  - in case of failed answer (evaluation < 7):
    - save to the list (both in memory and file) "do not learn today" with structure "key, date".
    - only keep record for "today", delete past ones

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

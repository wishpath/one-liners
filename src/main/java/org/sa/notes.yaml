problems:
  - update apps regarding new reading from concept files
  - why do i still use FilePath.TOPICS_PUBLIC? reduce these usages.
  - use file util where possible
  - TopicsPrinterApp update when topics will be folder names rather than filenames
  - open wiki text files after generating them
ideas:
  - there could be extra note for key for the user before the answer
    - it should tell what is expected to be mentioned in the answer
      - this should basically directly respond to the extra instructions given for this key
  - spaced repetition?
  - should score 0 be explicit?
  - additional instruction specific to a single concept
  - as every concept has been tried:
      - check how many of phrases has never received a score of 8, then 9, then 10
      - if for some concepts it is impossible to receive 10, add additional instructions for the AI. provide a couple of examples with answers that would match the evaluation of 10/10

maybe no, not needed:
  - defining separate elements/aspects of concept definition would be too complex for current scale of ~400 concepts
  - maybe not needed optimisation (and complexity added) for as few concepts as ~400: "separate types of concepts - INITIALISM, EXAMPLES, DEFAULT"
  - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
  - ai generated instruction
  - new command "pick exact <key>"
  - make command 'score 1' - print all the concepts with score 1

how to:
  - add submodule:
    - git submodule add <repository-link> <target-folder>
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions color in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

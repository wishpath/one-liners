problems:
  - csv should use comma (attempted answers)


scoring problems:
  - ICT system (components):
    - user answer:
      - "Information Computing Technology system componens - hardware, software, newtorks and people":
        - ai evaluation:
          - 8/10 : that's too high
          - "The definition captures the essence but has a typo: \"componens\" should be \"components,\" and \"newtorks\" should be \"networks.\" The acronym is incorrect; ICT stands for Information and Communication Technology. Overall, the essence is somewhat touched"
  - etcd etymology:
      - user: et cetera directory - in linux that is directory for various items
      - has to be: "et cetera" + "distributed" - comes from the /etc directory in Linux for configuration.
      - ai:
        - Rating:
          - 8/10 While "et cetera directory" slightly touches on the concept, the essence is more accurately captured by "et cetera" + "distributed," associating it with Linux’s /etc directory for configuration. To improve, emphasize the "distributed" aspect.


ideas:
  -

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ
   - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
   - prep and fix console colors:
      - blue - global narratives
      - cyan - inner narratives
      - yellow - AI
      - bright yellow - extra data
   - it is ok to not write unit tests if:
      - it's a prototype or throw-away app
      - there's only one developer.
      - input files are small and predictable.
      - You’ll iterate quickly, and the app will likely be rewritten or discarded.

how to:
  - add submodule:
    - git submodule add <repository-link> <target-folder>
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

problems:
  - finish how to: tone down the definitions in .concepts
  - emDash (â€”) and ndash do not print well in console
  - do tests?
  - remember answers in csv format: key, attempted answer, AI rating, datetime

ok, not needed to change: multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - ?

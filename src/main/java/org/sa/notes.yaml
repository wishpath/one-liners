  problems:
   - duplicated concepts? check for doubles
   - emDash (â€”) and ndash do not print well in console
   - do tests?

  ok_not_needed_to_change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.

  how_to:
   - update submodules:
       - git submodule update --remote --merge
       - then commit
   - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
       - ?

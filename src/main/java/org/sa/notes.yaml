problems:
  - unit tests:
    -
  - WikiExporter should export both general and (general and swed)
  - remove code from Concepts constructor:
      - initialize global objects straight with methods containing what is in constructor now.

ideas:
  -

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ
   - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

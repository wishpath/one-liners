problems:
  - if the result is 0/10 take away even more points
  - test API concept
  - write non-default user and ai instruction for each concept.
ideas:
  - improve instructions and succeed to get 10 from these concepts:
    - app.printKeyGradesThatAreAllBelowSomeGrade_veryConcise(key_attempts, 9);

maybe no, not needed:
  - defining separate elements/aspects of concept definition would be too complex for current scale of ~400 concepts
  - maybe not needed optimisation (and complexity added) for as few concepts as ~400: "separate types of concepts - INITIALISM, EXAMPLES, DEFAULT"
  - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
  - ai generated instruction
  - new command "pick exact <key>"
  - make command 'score 1' - print all the concepts with score 1

how to:
  - add submodule:
    - git submodule add <repository-link> <target-folder>
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions color in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

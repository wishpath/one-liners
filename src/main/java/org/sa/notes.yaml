problems:
  - "CFT (context: company structure);Please explain this: CFT (company structure);10;2025-06-24T15:50:45.726779500" - the answer was way longer / pasted whatever was copied from console...
  - prep and fix console colors:
    - blue - global narratives
    - cyan - inner narratives
    - yellow - AI
    - bright yellow - extra data
  - In colors do very bright gray
  - in color do boldColorInLine and similar
  - unit tests:
    -

ideas:

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ
   - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ
   - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
   - prep and fix console colors:
      - blue - global narratives
      - cyan - inner narratives
      - yellow - AI
      - bright yellow - extra data
   - it is ok to not write unit tests if:
      - it's a prototype or throw-away app
      - there's only one developer.
      - input files are small and predictable.
      - Youâ€™ll iterate quickly, and the app will likely be rewritten or discarded.

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

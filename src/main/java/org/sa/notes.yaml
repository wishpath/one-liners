problems:
  - do tests?
  - command "weaknesses"     - "print fails" "failed" "rerun failed concepts" - print from not today list
  - ";":
    - do not allow ";" in key (because not today list  and attempted answers separates key with it);
    - do not allow ";" in attempted answer (attempted answers list separates key with it);
    - do ; checks where needed
  - if a concept key gets deleted or altered, it has to be removed from scores as well


ideas:
  - in case of failed answer (evaluation < 7):
    - save to the list (both in memory and file) "do not learn today" with structure "key, date".
    - only keep record for "today", delete past ones
    - spaced repetition

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ

how to:
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

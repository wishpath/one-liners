problems:
  pick nth fragment 2 - should only print keys, not the values

ideas:
  - there could be extra note for key for the user before the answer
    - it should tell what is expected to be mentioned in the answer
      - this should basicly directly respond to the extra instructions given for this key
  - spaced repetition?
  - should score 0 be explicit?
  - additional instruction specific to a single concept
  - as every concept has been tried:
      - check how many of phrases has never received a score of 8, then 9, then 10
      - if for some concepts it is impossible to receive 10, add additional instructions for the AI. provide a couple of examples with answers that would match the evaluation of 10/10

ok, not needed to change:
   - multiple "=" characters in the concept, because when splitting by it, it is limited to 2 parts max.
   - characters print well in console, but gradle settings > build and run should be IntelliJ
   - spaced repetition - would not seem to bring much benefit, but would complicate code
   - prep and fix console colors:
      - blue - global narratives
      - cyan - inner narratives
      - yellow - AI
      - bright yellow - extra data
   - it is ok to not write unit tests if:
      - it's a prototype or throw-away app
      - there's only one developer.
      - input files are small and predictable.
      - Youâ€™ll iterate quickly, and the app will likely be rewritten or discarded.

maybe no, not needed:
  - new command "pick exact <key>"
  - make command 'score 1' - print all the concepts with score 1

how to:
  - add submodule:
    - git submodule add <repository-link> <target-folder>
  - update submodules:
    - git submodule update --remote --merge
    - then commit
  - tone down the definitions color in .concepts:
    - Settings > ... > File Types > "+" > in the "line comment" put "="

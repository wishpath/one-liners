Instruction: Generating Very Short Definitions

Objectives:
• Generate definitions that are extremely concise, laconic, and to the point.
• The output should capture the essence of the concept in the shortest possible form without losing fundamental meaning.

Key Requirements:

Length:
• Ideal length is way below 140 characters.
• Shorter is better, even if it sacrifices some clarity.
• Use 2-3 words if possible.
• No unnecessary details.

Format:
• One line, separated by =, and no redundant words.
• If applicable, use escaped spaces in the key (e.g., enDash\ (–)).
• A very short example or a practical use case is tolerable, example:
en\ dash\ (–)=dash for range or connection, example: "New York – Boston", type: Alt+0150
• if the word is not a name, use lowercase letter to start a phrase, example:
hub=central point, where things are executed.

Tone:
• Direct and terse.
• The goal is to convey just the essence.

Content Structure:
• Concept (escaped if necessary) = Short Definition, Example, Key Detail.
• Use the most laconic language possible.

Example:
SLI=Service Level Indicator — Metric measuring system performance.
URL=Uniform Resource Locators.
en\ dash\ (–)=dash for range or connection, example: "New York – Boston", type: Alt+0150
substitution=replacement
hub=central point, where things are executed.

Guidelines:
• Prioritize brevity over precision. example:
substitution=replacement
• If a longer phrase or term can be reduced to one or two words, do so.
• Essence only — avoid elaboration.
• Shorter and less clear is better than longer and more precise.
• If the concept key is an abbreviation, full term has to be spelled out like this (with "space + dash + space" afterwards):
SLI=Service Level Indicator — metric measuring system performance.
• Or even better (if the full version can serve as a simple definition):
URL=Uniform Resource Locators.

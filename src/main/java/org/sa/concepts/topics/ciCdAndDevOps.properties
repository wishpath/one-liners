DevOps=practices, principles, philosophies on automation of the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
DevSecOps=practice of integrating security seamlessly into every phase of the software development and delivery pipeline.
Jenkins=app for automating tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment. Written in Java.
pipeline=process of building, testing and deploying. Often associated with automatisation.
build=entire preparation for execution - compiling files, linking libraries, and packaging into a distributable format.
deploying=making app available on a target environment. For example production environment.
CI/CD=C - continuous (automatic), I - integration (merging code and testing it), D - delivery (deploying).
code\ integration=combining code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.
assemble=specific phase within the build process - collecting and combining individual components into larger units.
continuous\ integration\ components=VCS (e.g., Git), automated: builds, tests, feedback, build server (e.g., Jenkins).
Ingress\ Controller=Kubernetes component that manages external access to services.
git\ stash=git command to temporarily save uncommitted changes for later retrieval.
GitHub\ repository\ access\ HTTPS\ vs\ SSH=HTTPS uses username/password, SSH uses cryptographic keys (no password).
roll\ out=deployment and activation of a new product or feature for use.
heap\ space=memory area during program execution, for storing objects.
memory\ lack\ in\ Jenkins=due to large builds, extensive test suites, or insufficient memory allocation in JVM settings.

DC=data center — building housing IT systems.
DC components=includes telecommunications, storage, backup power, redundant connections, cooling, etc.
Docker=container runtime.
F5=advanced load balancer and application traffic controller.
F5 rules=logic to control service traffic (access, balance and security)
Hazelcast=software distributing data and compute over nodes; offers parallel processing and in-memory data grid.
Helm=package manager for Kubernetes - sets up and manages applications using Helm charts.
Helm chart=packages containing: container images, services, deployments, and configuration files.
IMDG=in-memory data grid - distributed computing technology that stores and manages data in RAM memory; fast access.
Kubernetes=container orchestration platform.
NFS=Network File System - for accessing files over a network as if they were on a local file system.
OpenShift=platform for container orchestration, automation, development, deployment, management; built on Kubernetes.
OpenShift vs Kubernetes?=OpenShift is built on top of Kubernetes, extending its capabilities with additional features.
PV (containerisation)=Persistent Volume — storage independent of containers, managed by platform or admin.
PVC (containerisation)=Persistent Volume Claim - request for PV storage by a user.
RBAC=Role-Based Access Control — restricts system access based on user roles.
Rancher features=provides user-friendly interface and tools for deployment and configuration.
Rancher platform=management platform for container orchestration and Kubernetes.
SSH=Secure Shell key pair (public/private) – authenticates and secures network communication.
VIP (OpenShift)=Virtual IP - routes traffic to services or pods within cluster, often for load balancing.
YAML=(YAML Ain't Markup Language) - is a human-readable data serialization format. Like XML or JSON.
base Java Docker image=foundation image with Java runtime for running apps in containers.
cloud=internet-based services like storage, compute, databases—no local hardware needed.
cluster=all nodes.
container=isolated unit with app code, dependencies, and settings.
container image=package with code, runtime, libs, tools—ready to run.
container instance=running version of an image.
container management platform=software system for deploying, scaling, and orchestrating containers across cluster.
container runtime=software component that runs and isolates containers.
endpoint=specific address or location in a network where communication or data transfer can occur.
etcd=configuration data shared among nodes in a distributed system.
etcd etymology="et cetera" + "distributed" - comes from the /etc directory in Linux for configuration.
garbage collection=is an automated process that identifies and frees up memory.
managed services (IT)=subset of services for ongoing management, maintenance, and support.
master node=responsible for managing the overall cluster state.
microservice=independent part of application for a specific function.
namespace (cluster)=divides cluster resources (pods, services, deployments) among projects or teams.
namespace (networking)=isolated environment where systems or apps has unique identifiers without conflicting others.
package (software)=set of files or resources bundled for software deployment.
pod=smallest deployable unit. It can hold one or more containers.
port=communication endpoint.
runtime=software providing components to execute an app (or period when a program is executing).
secret (Kubernetes)=resource storing sensitive data as key-value pairs in etcd.
throttling=intentional limitation or control of certain resources, actions, or processes within an app or a system.
worker node=computing node for running the containerized applications, has its own CPU, memory, and other resources.

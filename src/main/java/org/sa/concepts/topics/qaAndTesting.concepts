A/B testing=split testing - compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage.
Agile Test Quadrants=concept categorizing types of testing. Based on two axes: technology-facing and business-facing.
CTE (sandbox)=Common Test Environment.
DDoS attacks=Distributed denial-of service attacks.
DRT=Disaster Recovery Tests - process to prepare and test functions for actual disaster recovery.
GPA=general purpose app.
KPI=key performance indicator.
PII=Personally Identifiable Information - data that can identify an individual.
PPTE=pre production test environment.
SLI=Service Level Indicator - metric measuring system performance.
SLO=Service Level Objective - target level of performance for reliability.
TDM=Test Data Management.
UAT=User Acceptance Testing - validates software from end users' perspective for alignment with needs.
XSS=Cross-Site Scripting â€” security flaw allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
accessibility testing=ensures software usability for individuals with disabilities.
canary deployment=gradual rollout of a new app version to a small group before full deployment.
chaos engineering=injecting controlled instances of failure into a system to identify vulnerabilities.
compatibility testing=checks software performance across different environments and setups.
data pseudonymization=protecting privacy by encrypting personal indentifiers or replacing them with pseudonyms.
error budget=maximum allowable errors metric in a system within a specified time frame for reliability.
exploratory testing=flexible approach to uncover unexpected defects and understand behavior.
feature flag=feature toggle.
functional testing=Verifies that software features align with specified requirements.
integrated test environment=closely resembles production. integrated - combined components functioning together.
integration testing=ensures integrated software components work together as intended.
penetration testing=authorized simulated cyberattack to evaluate system security.
performance testing=Testing the performance and scalability of a software application under various conditions.
provisioning=making hardware, software, or data available and ready for use. e.g.: provisioning user accounts.
pseudonym=artificial identifier.
regression testing=Testing to ensure new changes don't negatively impact existing functionality.
security testing=identifies vulnerabilities and security risks in the software.
staging environment=closely resembles the production environment without affecting actual production data.
stub=small code replacing larger code, simulates unimplemented parts, aids testing isolation.
subsetting data=selecting and using a representative portion of a larger dataset.
test data management for enterprise=managing test data to meet organization-wide needs, not just individual teams.
test integration=combining software modules and testing them as a unified system.
test pilot=limited-scale trial of a new version before full release, for testing, feedback, and identifying issues.
unit testing=Testing individual units of code in isolation (AKA component testing).
usability testing=evaluates user-friendliness and overall user experience.

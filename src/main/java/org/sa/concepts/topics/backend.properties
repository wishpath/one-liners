Kafka\ (1)=a platform orchestrating data flow
Kafka\ (2)=distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data pipelines.
Kafka\ (3)=a platform orchestrating real-time, asynchronous communication between services, ensuring scalable, reliable data flow and event logging.
Kafka\ vs\ Kubernetes=Kafka orchestrates data streams; Kubernetes orchestrates container management.
data\ flow=movement and transformation of data within backend systems, focusing on ingestion, processing, and distribution.
throughput=rate at which data is processed or transmitted through a system, measured in units/events per interval.
Microsoft\ Azure=cloud computing platform.
real-time\ data\ flow=continuous, asynchronous transfer and processing of data as events occur
sticky\ session=ensures a user's requests are routed to the same server (no need to transfer copies of session data, Java classes donâ€™t need serialization).

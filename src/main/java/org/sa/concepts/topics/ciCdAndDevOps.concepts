code integration=combining code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.
artifactory=stores built artifacts (JAR, WAR, binaries), not source code.
memory lack in Jenkins=due to large builds, extensive test suites, or insufficient memory allocation in JVM settings.
GitHub repository access HTTPS vs SSH=HTTPS uses username/password, SSH uses cryptographic keys (no password).
Ingress Controller=Kubernetes component that manages external access to services.
assemble=specific phase within the build process - collecting and combining individual components into larger units.
roll out=deployment and activation of a new product or feature for use.
.war file=Web Application Archive - containing app, packaged and, ready for deployment.
Ivy=dependency management tool for Java, automates retrieving libraries and modules during build or deployment.
pipeline=process of building, testing and deploying. Often associated with automatisation.
Jenkins=app for automating tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment. Written in Java.
artifact=built file produced by a build process, like a JAR, WAR, or binary, ready for deployment or distribution.
DevOps=practices, principles, philosophies on automation of the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.
Ivy integration to Gradle=Gradle plugin for Ivy repos, allows using Ivy modules and dependencies in Gradle builds.
DevSecOps=practice of integrating security into every phase of the software development and delivery pipeline.
build=entire preparation for execution - compiling files, linking libraries, and packaging into a distributable format.
deploying=making app available on a target environment. For example production environment.
continuous integration components=VCS (e.g., Git), automated: builds, tests, feedback, build server (e.g., Jenkins).
heap space=memory area during program execution, for storing objects.
CI/CD=C - continuous (automatic), I - integration (merging code and testing it), D - delivery (deploying).
git stash=git command to temporarily save uncommitted changes for later retrieval.

signup metadata=contextual info: registrationSource, referralCode, ipAddress, verification status.

signup raw data=core data fields: userId, username, email, registration date, status.
semantic registration message=JSON structure for user signup. Includes raw data and metadata.
bad separation of concerns (DDD)=overlapping responsibilities causing tight coupling and confusion.

good separation of concerns (DDD)=clear, distinct parts with minimal overlap or dependencies.
domain=business area, e.g., retail, banking, finance, healthcare.

domain vs bounded context=domain usually contains multiple bounded contexts.
separation of concerns (DDD)=dividing system into distinct parts, each handling a specific responsibility.

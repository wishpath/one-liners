AWS=Amazon cloud platform for scalable computing, storage, and services.
Azure=Microsoft cloud platform for apps, data, and services.
Google Cloud=Google cloud platform for hosting, data, and AI.
Kafka (1/2)=platform orchestrating data flow
Kafka (2/2)=distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data pipelines.
Kafka vs Kubernetes=Kafka orchestrates data streams; Kubernetes orchestrates container management.
Kerberos=authentication protocol.
Kerberos keytab=file storing username, service name and key to request Kerberos tickets.
Kerberos keytab key=encrypted, requested from authentication service using user password for target service.
Kerberos principal=identity containing user and service, e.g.: user@SERVICE.COM
Kerberos ticket=credential proving identity without sending password or keytab to service.
cloud platform=online infrastructure for hosting apps, data, and services.
data flow=data moves and changes through ingestion, processing, and output in backend systems.
on-premises datacenter=organization-owned data center on-site, unlike cloud or third-party hosting.
real-time data flow=continuous, asynchronous transfer and processing of data as events occur
sticky session=user always routed to same server for session consistency.
sticky session benefit=avoids session data transfer and Java object serialization.
throughput=rate at which data is processed or transmitted through a system, measured in units/events per interval.

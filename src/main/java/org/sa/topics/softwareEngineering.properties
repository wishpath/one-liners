DevSecOps=practice of integrating security seamlessly into every phase of the software development and delivery pipeline.
Difference\ between\ Kafka\ and\ Kubernetes\ in\ the\ sense\ that\ both\ are\ platforms\ of\ orchestration=Kafka is the data traffic controller, while Kubernetes is the container traffic controller.
Encapsulation=Hiding internal elements of object or service. Provides clear separation. Improves maintainability.
Etcd=configuration data shared among nodes in a distributed system.
Etcd\ etymology="et cetera" + "distributed" - comes from the /etc directory in Linux for configuration.
F5=advanced load balancer and application traffic controller.
F5\ rules=logic to control service traffic (access, balance and security)
Factory\ design\ pattern=provides an interface for creating instances of a class, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
Firewall=network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules.
Firewall\ opening=configuration change to allow specific traffic through the firewall, enabling communication over a given port or IP range.
Framework=reusable and extensible structure that helps building applications.
GCT=general compliance testing - testing processes to meet standards and regulations.
Gateway=A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts data from one protocol format to another.
Gateway\ team\ in\ an\ enterprise=ensures a secure digital environment by managing network security, access controls, and incident response protocols to safeguard data effectively.
Ingress\ Controller=Kubernetes component that manages external access to services.
Jar\ hell=challenges arising from conflicts or compatibility issues between different versions of Java Archive (JAR) files, often encountered in projects with multiple dependencies.
Jenkins=automating tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment.
Kafka\ (1)=a platform orchestrating data flow
Kafka\ (2)=distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data pipelines.
Kafka\ (3)=a platform orchestrating real-time, asynchronous communication between services, ensuring scalable, reliable data flow and event logging.
Memoization\ technique=storing the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
Microsoft\ Azure=cloud computing platform.
OKR=objectives and key requirements.
ORM=Object-Relational Mapping - interaction between a database and OOP. database operations are performed using objects and classes rather than raw SQL queries. E.g.\: Hibernate for Java.
PI\ Planning=Program Increment Planning.
PI\ planning=Program Increment planning - aligns teams, sets objectives, and plans iterations collaboratively.
PR=public release.
Postmortem=structured analysis that takes place after a failure has occurred.
RBAC=role based access control - system of user access rights based on their role within an organization.
Real-time\ data\ flow=Continuous, asynchronous transfer and processing of data as events occur
SSL\ (1)=Secure Sockets Layer - standard security protocol that encrypts the communication between a web server and a browser to protect sensitive information.
SSL\ (2)=Secure Sockets Layer - protects communication over a network or internet. Encrypts the data between browser and website server. Successor - Transport Layer Security - TLS.
Sticky\ session=ensures a user's requests are routed to the same server (no need to transfer copies of session data, Java classes donâ€™t need serialization).
Subnet=subnetwork - segment of a larger network. Subnetting improves network performance, security, and organization.
SwiftUI=user interface framework developed by Apple for building apps across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
TDC=test data compliance - test data meets standards and regulations.
Technical\ debt=accumulated code imperfections.
Unix=operating system. Linux is a Unix - like, but not a direct descendant.
VIP\ (OpenShift)=Virtual IP - routes traffic to services or pods within a cluster, often for load balancing.
VPN=Virtual Private Network - encrypted and tunneled connection to trusted remote server, where your identity is hidden, but all the data in the internet accessed.
VPN\ Whitelisting=a security measure that allows only specific IP addresses or devices to access a service through a VPN.
Wireshark=app for network troubleshooting.
asynchronous=each next task starts without previous one ending. Task become concurrent.
build=entire process for execution - compiling source files, linking libraries, and packaging resources into a distributable format
credential=username, password, or token, used to authenticate and authorize a user.
defensive\ programming=ensuring that software behaves as expected even when encountering unexpected inputs or conditions. Input validation, Error handling, Robustness, Fail-safe defaults, Clear documentation.
deploying=making app available on a target environment. For example production environment.
deterministic=same input will always produce the same outcome.
git\ stash=\ to temporarily save changes (that are not ready to be committed) to a temporary storage, that can be retrieved later.
hash=unique representation of the input data. Used for encryption, integrity verification, indexing etc. Deterministic, fixed output size, irreversible, collision resistant.
hashing=transforming data into a fixed-size code. Deterministic. One hash code can mean multiple original data (collision case).
hub=central point, where things are executed.
irreversible\ data\ transformation=not possible to obtain the original input from the outcome.
landing\ page=entry point for a particular section of a website. Prompts a specific action from visitors, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, downloading a resource, or filling out a form.
node=machine with individual instance.
operational\ risk=risk of loss in the result of\: internal process, people, system, external events.
operations\ specialist=takes care of IT infrastructure\: severs, networks, hardware. Deploys and configures software apps
overlay=(web) - graphical element that is superimposed on top of another elements, typically to display additional content or provide a focused interaction area.
pipeline=process of building, testing and deploying. Often associated with automatisation.
present()=method in fluentlenium that checkts if the element is there in the DOM.
synchronous=each next task starts when previous one ends.
